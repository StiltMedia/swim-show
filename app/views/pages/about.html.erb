          <h2>Splashy Start</h2>
          <br>
          <p>In 1982, a small group of sales representatives decided to organize a special event to bring together all of the central players from all aspects of the swimwear industry under one roof. They chose Miami since more than 60 percent of the industry’s business at that time was handled by sales representatives at the Miami Merchandise Mart with or without showrooms. The first show featured 15 representatives with 30 collections. Staying true to its original mission, the SwimShow isn’t one of the largest events of its kind, it is THE largest swimwear trade show in the world, featuring thousands of buyers from dozens of countries each year.</p>
