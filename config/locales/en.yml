# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:

# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:

#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es

The first show featured 15 representatives with 30 collections. Staying true to its original mission, the SwimShow isn’t one of the largest events of its kind, it is THE largest swimwear trade show in the world, featuring thousands of buyers from dozens of countries each year."
